# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Abstract:

I built an app for playing rock-paper-scissors. It also includes a more complicated version that has 2 opponents that result in victory, and 2 that result in defeat. Users, can select from either game mode on load, or by utilizing the change game button. The app also tracks wins and has a few fun animations in relation to the 'fight' after selecting your 'fighter'. The fighters are emoji images that are text readable from my own testing, and were quite fun to work with.

## Installation Instructions:
1. Fork this repository.
2. `cd` into the desired directory.
3. Clone it down to your machine using `git clone git@github.com:vsriqui/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git`.
4. `cd` into the created directory.
5. Run `open index.html` to launch the application in your default browser.

## Context:

The project was assigned in week 5 of Turing Module 4, and I was given 9 days to finish the project. I likely spent 14-16 hours on the coding aspects of it, perhaps 6-10 refactoring and researching. It was a fun project, and I quite enjoyed it.

## Learning Goals:

- Learning how to write concise HTML.
- Learning how to write concise CSS, while simultaneously getting a beautiful looking end result.
- Using Javascript that updates the data model based on interaction on the DOM, then uses the data model to update the DOM.
- Trying to write more concise and effective Javascript.

## Wins + Challenges:

I had several wins and challenges during this project. One of my largest challenges ultimately was writing the architecture for the app in javascript in a concise way. A win in that respect would be the many refactors I went through that eliminated many lines of code. Another big challenge was trying to figure out how I would want the 'fighters' represented in the data, a win in that respect was realizing emojis could be used in the data model. I also tried my level best to institute BEM, but did find using IDs for the 'fighters' displayed on the DOM to be useful. I did find exploring the joy of animations to be the most fun I derived from this project, and look forward to playing with CSS more in the future.
